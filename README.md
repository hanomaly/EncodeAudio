# Encode Audio
This is the source code for an application that copies to the clipboard an audio file in the form of numbers interpretable by an arduino, so that you can use the digital pins to directly play audio through speakers.

### Dependencies:
- This is a [Processing](https://processing.org/) sketch
- It uses the Minim library. If you don't have this, in Processing, go to 
```
Tools -> Add Tool... -> Libraries
```
and search for Minim, then install it.
